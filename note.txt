Hey y'all! I've noticed a bit of use for this project and would love some feedback! If you have ideas for further extension of this project, 
or have just used it for some cool exploits, please let me know about it on twitter at @TerminalJockey or via email at TerminalJockey@protonmail.com

Thanks and happy exploiting!
